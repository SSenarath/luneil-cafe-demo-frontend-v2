# Restaurant Management App for Luneil Cafe

At the beginning of my coding journey, I developed a restaurant management app with my sister using Node.js that can process orders, track order history and store product details to fulfill the business need of my momâ€™s small catering business. Back then, lacking experience in front-end frameworks, the code wasn't as streamlined as I would have preferred. Recently, I started re-creating the application using my experience with Nuxt, Element UI and Tailwind CSS.  While the application remains a work in progress, you can explore the current status below. Please note that the demo version excludes real ingredient information (family secrets, you know!)
